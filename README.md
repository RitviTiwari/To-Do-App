# To-Do-App
## Project Overview: 
The to-do app is a task management tool designed to help users organize their daily activities by adding, categorizing, prioritizing, and tracking tasks.

## Features:

- **Basic Task Management**: Users can easily add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Categories**: Tasks can be organized into categories like Work, Personal, and Urgent, allowing users to manage different aspects of their lives.
- **Priority Levels**: Each task can be assigned a priority level (Low, Medium, High), helping users focus on what's most important.
- **Due Dates**: Users can set due dates for tasks, aiding in time management.

  
-**Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring that the user's task list is saved even when the browser is closed.

## Technical Aspects:
- **Front-End Development**: The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a user-friendly interface and responsive design.

- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, which allows for persistent data storage without a backend server.

- **Event Handling**: JavaScript handles user interactions, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting them, using event listeners.
